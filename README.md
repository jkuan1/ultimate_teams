# UltiApp
Hi!
The app name is still a work in progress, so for now, just call us UltiApp!

UltiApp is an app developed by some fellow ultimate players who are looking for a single app that will allow teams to connect, communicate, and schedule practices and games. The key features we want UltiApp to offer are:
 - An interactive Calendar
 - Attendance tracking
 - Team work spaces
 - Notifactions
 - An announcment feed
 - Playbook
 - Personal profiles
