## How to run the server locally with ngrok:
1. Run code that will be on server (Main.js)

```
#in back_end directory
node main.js
```

2. Open a second terminal 
3. Type './ngrok http XXXX' where xxxx is your port number (5000 for us). Command must happen in the same directory where ngrok.exe is installed
4. Server will run until you turn it off with `Ctrl+C`
